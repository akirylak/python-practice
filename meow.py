#delibrately create an infinite loop
#common paridime if you want to do things again and again until the input has been reached
while True:
    #user than input
    n = int(input("What's n? "))
    #if greater than 0
    if n > 0:
        #breaks out of the loop
        break

#ex for i in range of n = 3
for i in range(n):
    #prints 3 times
    print("meow")
